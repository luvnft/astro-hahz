# Hahz.live IAM Web5 social media platform launches

Hahz.live IAM is built with Nostr is an open social media protocol empowering lots of software such as this client. The experience is kind of like Twitter except that you control your own account, and you can post to many different independent places called "relays". People are finding many additional uses for NOSTR that go far beyond micro-blogging or chatting, but this client is focused on those.

Nostr stands for "Notes and Other Stuff Transmitted by Relays."

## How IAM Works

Account > Keys

This is where you can import a key (nsec or ncryptsec) or generate a new one, or delete your existing one. It also shows your nprofile which you can share with other people who want to follow you.
Account > Profile
Here is where you set your profile. Editing these fields will change your profile on nostr.
