## Features of Hahz.live TV Compared to Other Platforms

Hahz.live TV redefines live-streaming by addressing the gaps in popular platforms like **Twitch** and **Kick**. Here’s how it stands out:

### **1. Creator-Centric Rewards**
- **Hahz.live TV:** Rewards viewers directly with crypto (Bitcoin, NFTs) for participating in streams.
- **Twitch/Kick:** Focus primarily on ad revenue and subscriptions, which benefit creators but offer nothing to viewers.

### **2. Purpose-Driven Content**
- **Hahz.live TV:** Exclusively streams spiritual, educational, and purpose-driven content designed to uplift and empower audiences.
- **Twitch/Kick:** Largely focused on gaming and entertainment, often lacking educational or community-driven programming.

### **3. Viewer Ownership**
- **Hahz.live TV:** Provides viewers with a stake in the platform through blockchain airdrops, turning passive consumption into active participation.
- **Twitch/Kick:** Viewers remain consumers, with no tangible rewards or ownership opportunities.

### **4. Interactive Engagement**
- **Hahz.live TV:** Features live Q&A sessions where viewers can interact directly with **The Wizard of Hahz** to learn about building wealth and purpose economies.
- **Twitch/Kick:** Engagement is often limited to text-based chats with minimal real-time creator interaction.
