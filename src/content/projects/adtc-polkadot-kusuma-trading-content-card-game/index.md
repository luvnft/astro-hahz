 As a former Atlanta celebrity photographer, I’ve curated a collection of 30,000 one-of-a-kind photos and videos from nearly every major Atlanta event between 2010 and 2015. This collection features influencers, musicians, reality stars, and more. These moments are now tokenized as ADTCs (Atlanta Digital Tokenized Collectibles) on the Polkadot Kusama blockchain, creating opportunities for everyone to invest in themselves and others while building an ADTC economy.

As Diddy's trial garners more attention, the value of these ADTCs is poised to increase. To purchase an ADTC, you’ll need a Talisman wallet and $KSM. After buying an ADTC, tag me on social media @wizardofhahz for a repost. You can also connect with other ADTC holders by following me or joining the ATL5D Discord’s ADTC channel.

I’ll host ADTC live events to share the stories behind each drop and facilitate auctions.

Why ADTCs Are Valuable:

Scarcity: Each ADTC is a 1-of-1 collectible, increasing its uniqueness and demand.
Dynamic Value: Similar to real estate, the value of an ADTC is based on the highest sale price.
Utility: You can borrow against, stake, sell, or pass down your ADTC as a legacy asset.

Spoiler of how this story ends: ADTCs went viral, and everyone holding one became spiritually wealthy and $KSM millionaires. Don't miss your chance to be part of this movement!
