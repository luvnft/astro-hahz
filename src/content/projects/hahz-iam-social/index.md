To make the internet great again, I had to remove the middleman and organize it on Web5, creating a space where the world can find it all in one location.

Nostr is revolutionizing social media for those tired of having their content policed by AI that aligns with agendas driven by profit, greed, and control. It’s an open social media protocol that empowers a wide range of software applications, including this client. The experience is similar to Twitter, but with a key difference: you control your own account. You can post to various independent locations called "relays," giving you the freedom to decide how and where your content is shared.

People are discovering that Nostr goes far beyond micro-blogging or chatting. While this client focuses on those uses, the protocol is inspiring innovations in areas like payments, file sharing, and even decentralized marketplaces.

What is Nostr?
The name stands for "Notes and Other Stuff Transmitted by Relays." At its core, it’s a protocol designed to create a decentralized and censorship-resistant communication network. With Nostr, you own your keys, and by extension, your digital identity—there's no reliance on centralized platforms to host or moderate your content.
